# Rename of bem-controls into bem-components

Accodring to plan, we renamed bem-controls repository into bem-components.

To gain backward compatibility [bem-controls](https://github.com/bem/bem-controls/) repository contains a 
copy with issues disabled, that was created at the moment of renaming.

Unfortunately, we have lost old links to issues. If you need them, you need to switch it in url https://github.com/bem/bem-controls/issues/106 a part 
"bem-controls" to "bem-components" (https://github.com/bem/bem-components/) directly.

It is impossible to create read-only repository. Therefore please try not to push there anything. 
If you accidently made a mistake, please, 
make sure that you pushed the same commit into [bem-components](https://github.com/bem/bem-components/).
