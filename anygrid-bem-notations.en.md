# CSS Grids Generator AnyGrid that uses BEM-notations and etc!

[Vasya Aksenov](https://twitter.com/outring) developed a great project — **CSS Grids Generator** called [AnyGrid](http://anygrid.net/). 

You give it a number of columns, gutter width, check a box if legacy IE support, container context respore or [BEM-notations usage for CSS](http://bem.info/method/definitions/) is needed, than press a button and, voila, your code is ready to use!

Moreover, before Opera 12 release it was the only fluid grid, that worked correctly in that browser. By now it is the only grid that works closely to the way [CSS3 Grid](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/) will work because of independant modules. 

To develop it's main functionality adjacent descendant selectors were left aside: all module sizes are calculated relatively grid container size. You may use as many crid configurations (regarding a number of columns) as you like, with every configuration your CSS file will grow bigger only on a size of one rule. 

It is the only grid with ~~no one needed~~ killer-feature that allows making *выноски* from module's content with the same size grid. 

And it is the only no documentation grid :D

Besides, it can become your ~~chance to rock the world~~ project: Vasya is actively looking for those, who is interested in maintaining and frther developing the project!
