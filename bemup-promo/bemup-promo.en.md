# BEMup: watch it, feel it! 

First meetup about BEM happened to be on August 2, in Moscow office of Yandex and was called 
[BEMup](http://bitly.com/bemup).

During 3 hours in a friendly atmosphere Yandex developers and programmers from other IT companies shared news, 
BEM implementation experience, discussed plans, difficulties and their ways of solving them.

BEM team talked about latest releases in [bem-tools](http://bit.ly/ru-bemtools), shared details of 
[bem-core](http://github.com/bem/bem-core) development and plans about [bem-bl](https://github.com/bem/bem-bl) 
future, showed their view on opensource development and the community we are building around BEM. 

We also explained technical details of contributing into the project, what “well-written pull requests” are, 
what flow in BEM development we have, how to test changes in BEM-project correctly, and what you can do to try 
out helping us in developing BEM.

During the preparation times we have got proposals to give out talks from other developers outside Yandex. 

At the end we have got 2 developers sharing their BEM implementation experience: 
[Vassily Chernov](https://twitter.com/bivihoba), lead frontend developer at **Softline**, came from Orenburg, 
and [Vladimir Dovydenko](https://twitter.com/dovyden), frontend developer from **TKS Bank**, Moscow. 

They talked about the conditions under which they implement BEM in their projects, what cases they solve using 
BEM-methodology, how do they use tools and write CSS, in general shared their difficulties and costs they have because 
of large-scale changes, what results they have achieved and what plans they have.

As a bonus track we had talks about [bem-mvc](https://github.com/bem/bem-mvc) library with Todo written as an 
example and implementation of BEM technologies in Islands platform that Yandex launched recently.

[Vassily Chernov](https://twitter.com/bivihoba), lead frontend developer at **Softline** and meetup’s speaker, 
shared, what he liked about BEMup:

> Meetup was a success. I do not know how such events should look like, but everything went pretty well. I had 
concrete expectations, and my expectations met. It costs a lot to see in the eyes of those who has as well so 
called BEM brain "disease" as I do! It was interesting to hear out talks and comments of Yandex developers and guys from 
the industry. 

> I would like to highlight a talk about Islands libraries. Would be great to have more details such as this 
talk was about. It is interesting to hear out about real projects, solutions, and not only from Yandex, as well 
as to ask questions and even troll. Personally I was asked more about processes than technologies. How to prove BEM 
is a good choice in front of the colleagues? How many projects we do using BEM? How to agree with each other? How 
to start with a block library out of your project? 

> I really hope you will continue this start, and BEMups will be regular events. Because this is a great option to 
exchange experience and motivate yourself to achieve the next BEM level. Me myself, for instance, was inspired to 
finish a thing I postponed during the half a year! Thanks to Yandex and you, guys, for such an event. Staying BEMed, 
Vasya.

BEM team also made few conslusions.

[Mikhail Troshev](http://twitter.com/ya_mishanga):

> Developers use our project-stub, we need to keep it in up-to-date fixed and working condition. This is a BEM face 
for most of the people.

[Sergey Berezhnoy](http://twitter.com/veged):

> I have heard during a coffee break that some developers talked to each other about how they use BEM technologies 
and how they implemented them. It is cool that non-Yandex developers argued for BEM before the others.

> We need to continue BEMuping but think twice what we give developers, what for they come to BEMup and are going 
to come. For instance, several people said they lack concrete technical examples and talks (maybe even workshops). 
Not necessary to go that way, but we need to formulate the essence of the event first.

[Vladimir Grinenko](http://twitter.com/tadatuta):

> I was surprised to see such a high percentage of developers using bem-tools. I thought I would need to tell what 
bem-tools are before getting into news. But they knew already! 

[Sergey Maksimov](http://twitter.com/dosyara):

> Meetup went well. Those who came really use the idea and believe in it. Without such an audience the result might 
be different. I think it is worthy to ask external speakers to share not only their «success stories» but more 
concrete examples of realization.

> According to overall feeling, BEM is still associated with a principle of naming convention and with structuring 
a page with blocks, elements, all that stuff. Those who tried to go further and use Yandex experience faced 
imperfection and opacity of our inner processes. For instance, an absence of development plans, clear release cycles, 
absence (or bad quality) of documentation. There are serious issues for a serious development. 

Thanks to meetup we have got all of these feedback, made ourselves conclusions and will be working towards an 
improvement of the product and sharing this with you during future BEMups. 

Such events and your feedback help us a lot to see those we can not see because of specifics of work. Thank you so much!

More than **50 frontend developers** and IT leaders from Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Orenburg, Ivanovo, Serpukhov, 
Obninsk, Volgograd came to meetup.

Watch how we did it in a promo video with English subtitles.
